# PWA Viewport & Zoom Policy

Status: Active SSOT
Version: 5.0.2
Last updated: 2026-08-08

GDS owns one canonical answer for mobile viewport configuration, including whether a product may disable pinch-zoom for an installed PWA that should feel like a native app shell. Consumers must use `getGdsPwaViewportMetaContent(...)` from `@sovereignsquad/gds-theme` instead of hand-writing a `<meta name="viewport">` string per project.

## The two lanes

| `zoomPolicy` | Behavior | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `'browser-default'` (default) | `width=device-width, initial-scale=1` — zoom untouched | Nearly every product. Required for any product with body text, articles, forms, tables, or other reading-heavy content. |
| `'app-shell-fixed'` | Adds `maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no` | Only a bounded, reviewed exception for an installed (`display: standalone`/`fullscreen`) PWA app-shell that a product owner has explicitly decided should suppress pinch-zoom for a native-app feel. |

```ts
import { getGdsPwaViewportMetaContent } from '@sovereignsquad/gds-theme';

getGdsPwaViewportMetaContent();
// "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"

getGdsPwaViewportMetaContent({ zoomPolicy: 'app-shell-fixed', viewportFit: 'cover' });
// "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover"
```

GDS does not render this tag itself — `<meta name="viewport">` must be set once in the document head, outside React render, alongside the mandatory `@sovereignsquad/gds-theme/styles.css` import (see `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`):

- **Vite** (`index.html`): `<meta name="viewport" content="<%= viewport content %>" />`, or set it directly since the value is static per build.
- **Next.js App Router**: return the string from `generateViewport()` in the root layout.

## Why `app-shell-fixed` is an exception, not a default

Disabling user zoom conflicts with two release-gate accessibility requirements in `FOUNDATION.md` (§1.5 Accessibility as a Release Gate):

- **WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text** — text must be resizable up to 200% without loss of content or function.
- **WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow** — content must reflow to a single column at 320 CSS px without requiring horizontal scrolling or zoom.

A fixed viewport that blocks pinch-zoom removes one of the two ways low-vision users compensate (the other being OS-level display/font-size scaling, which `app-shell-fixed` does **not** and must never block). This is why the lane is opt-in, reviewed per product, and documented — not the shipped default.

**Practical caveat:** most current mobile browsers (iOS Safari 10+, current Chrome/Android WebView) ignore `user-scalable=no` outright and always allow pinch-zoom. `app-shell-fixed` mainly suppresses double-tap-to-zoom and affects older/embedded WebViews — treat it as a best-effort native-app signal, not a guaranteed zoom lock, and never as a substitute for the mitigations below.

## Required mitigations when choosing `app-shell-fixed`

A product adopting `app-shell-fixed` must still satisfy, and document per this checklist (owner + review date recorded in the product's local adoption note, mirroring the exception-contract shape in `EXCEPTION_SURFACES.md`):

1. **Owner** — a named product owner accountable for the choice.
2. **Reflow still works** — every route renders correctly at 320 CSS px width with no horizontal scroll, independent of zoom (WCAG 1.4.10 stays satisfied through layout, not through zoom).
3. **OS-level text scaling still works** — the app must never set a fixed root font size that ignores the user's OS/browser text-size preference (`rem`-based type only, no hard-coded `px` type scale). GDS typography tokens already satisfy this; do not override them with fixed pixel values.
4. **No unique zoom-dependent content** — nothing on the bounded app-shell surface should require pinch-zoom to read or operate in the first place; if it does, the surface is not a good candidate for this lane.
5. **Scope stays narrow** — apply the fixed viewport only to the installed/standalone app-shell entry point, not to any marketing, docs, article, or public browser-tab surface the same product may also serve.
6. **Testing** — verify at OS text-size 200% (or the platform-equivalent "Larger Text" setting) that the shell remains usable before shipping.
7. **Exit condition** — revert to `'browser-default'` if the product later grows reading-heavy content (articles, long-form tables, dense forms) that the standalone shell was not scoped for.

## Input-focus auto-zoom — a separate mechanism, guarded by default

The two lanes above (`zoomPolicy`) only ever control **pinch-zoom** (`user-scalable`). Mobile Safari and Chrome have an entirely separate zoom behavior: the browser force-zooms the whole page when a focused text input's *computed* font-size is under 16px, regardless of `zoomPolicy` or any viewport meta content. This is not something `getGdsPwaViewportMetaContent(...)` can affect at all.

GDS guards this by default, not via this API: `gdsTheme`'s `components.Input.vars` floors the effective font-size of every Input-based control (`TextInput`, `Textarea`, `NativeSelect`, `Select`, `PasswordInput`, `NumberInput`, `MultiSelect`, `Autocomplete`, `TagsInput` — including `gds-admin`'s `AdminTextInput`/`AdminTextarea`/`AdminSelect`, which are thin pass-throughs over the same Mantine primitives) to at least 16px at the risky `xs`/`sm`/default sizes, using `max(1rem, var(--mantine-font-size-sm))` so OS-level text-size scaling is never blocked. `md`/`lg`/`xl` sizes already render at 16px+ and are untouched.

Unlike `app-shell-fixed`, this requires no opt-in and no per-product review — it only raises a legibility floor on already-tiny text and never touches pinch-zoom or OS text scaling, so it carries none of the WCAG 1.4.4/1.4.10 trade-offs discussed above. If your app uses raw native `<input>`/`<select>`/`<textarea>` elements outside any GDS component (for example, a fully custom form), this guard does not reach them — apply the same `max(1rem, 1em)`-style floor yourself.

## Relationship to the PWA manifest

`zoomPolicy: 'app-shell-fixed'` only affects in-browser zoom gestures. It does not, by itself, make a site installable or standalone — that is controlled by the web app manifest's `display` field (`standalone` or `fullscreen`) and a registered service worker, which remain product-owned and outside GDS's scope. Use the two together deliberately: a manifest `display: standalone` PWA is the intended target for this lane, not a plain browser-tab site. GDS ships a governed manifest **generator** (`getGdsWebAppManifest`, below) so the manifest's colors stay aligned to the active theme, but serving the manifest and registering a service worker stay product-owned.

## PWA thin-build helpers (#458)

GDS is a component/theme library, not an app framework, so its PWA surface is a deliberate **partial build** (see [`RESPONSIVE_AND_PLATFORM_GUIDANCE.md`](RESPONSIVE_AND_PLATFORM_GUIDANCE.md)): the standards-based pieces that belong in a design system, and nothing more. **Explicit non-goals** (owned by the consuming app): service-worker/offline caching and an install-prompt UX framework — GDS documents the integration point only.

### Web app manifest — `getGdsWebAppManifest(options)`

Server-safe generator (`@sovereignsquad/gds-theme`, `/server`, `/client`) that returns a valid, spec-shaped web-app-manifest object from GDS theme/brand inputs, so the manifest's `theme_color`/`background_color` stay aligned to the active theme instead of a hand-maintained duplicate. GDS does not serve the manifest — serialize the result and expose it at your `manifest.webmanifest` URL.

```ts
// Next.js app/manifest.ts
import { getGdsWebAppManifest, resolveGdsVibeTheme } from '@sovereignsquad/gds-theme/server';

const vibe = resolveGdsVibeTheme('cosmic');

export default function manifest() {
  return getGdsWebAppManifest({
    name: 'Cosmic App',
    themeColor: vibe.primary,
    backgroundColor: vibe.canvasLight,
    display: 'standalone', // default
    icons: [{ src: '/icon-512.png', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png', purpose: 'any maskable' }],
  });
}
```

Required: `name`, `themeColor`, `backgroundColor` (throws otherwise). Defaults: `display: 'standalone'`, `start_url`/`scope`/`id: '/'`, and `short_name` falls back to `name`.

### Standalone detection — `useGdsStandaloneDisplayMode()`

Client hook (`@sovereignsquad/gds-theme`, `/client`) reporting whether the app is running as an installed PWA and its current `display-mode`, updating live if the mode changes mid-session. SSR-safe: returns `{ isStandalone: false, displayMode: 'browser' }` until mounted on the client. Detects `standalone`/`fullscreen`/`minimal-ui` via `display-mode` media queries plus iOS Safari's legacy `navigator.standalone`.

```tsx
const { isStandalone } = useGdsStandaloneDisplayMode();
return isStandalone ? <AppShellHeader /> : <BrowserHeaderWithInstallHint />;
```

### Safe-area insets — `gdsSafeAreaInset`

`@sovereignsquad/gds-theme/styles.css` defines governed `--gds-safe-area-inset-{top,right,bottom,left}` custom properties, each `env(safe-area-inset-*, 0px)` (resolving to `0px` on non-notched displays). `gdsSafeAreaInset` exposes them as ready-to-use `var(...)` strings for JS/inline styling, so shells and consumers read one governed inset source instead of hard-coding `env(safe-area-inset-*)`:

```tsx
import { gdsSafeAreaInset } from '@sovereignsquad/gds-theme';

<footer style={{ paddingBottom: gdsSafeAreaInset.bottom }} />;
```
