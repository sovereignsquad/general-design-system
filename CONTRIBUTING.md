This repository is shared design-system infrastructure.

## Standing Operating Rules (non-negotiable)

These apply to every change, every contributor (human or agent), regardless
of task. Full detail for agents in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

1. **Zero-tolerance quality gate for `main`** — no deprecation warnings, no
   warnings, no errors anywhere in the build/lint/test/`verify:release`
   chain for anything committed or merged to `main`. Fix the source; never
   suppress or hide the signal.
2. **Always work from GitHub issues** — decompose every request into
   deliverables and record them as GitHub issues before/while implementing.
   Reference and close issues from the commits that resolve them.
3. **Documentation is mandatory** — ship doc updates in the same change set
   as the behavior they describe, not as a follow-up.
4. **Industry-standard Definition of Done is mandatory** — implemented,
   tested, clean build/lint/test, documented, traceable to an issue, edge
   cases considered, committed and pushed. Explicitly checked, not assumed.
5. **Never guess** — read, research, and analyse the actual code/docs/system
   state before acting or reporting a result. If something can't be verified,
   say so instead of filling the gap with an assumption.
6. **Pre-authorized branch/push operations** — the repository owner uses
   an AI coding assistant on iOS mobile with no terminal access. `dev` and `preview`
   branches may be created, merged, and pulled without asking first. When the
   owner says "commit and push to main," push directly to `main` (no PR,
   no waiting for approval) — provided Rule 1's quality gate passes.

## Allowed Change Types

- Shared foundation rules (`FOUNDATION.md`)
- Component and UX contracts (`COMPONENTS_AND_PATTERNS.md`)
- Cross-project pattern-service contracts (`PATTERN_SERVICE_MODEL.md`)
- Governance, migration, or enforcement processes (`GOVERNANCE_AND_ADOPTION.md`)
- Project-specific migration plans under `PROJECTS/`

## Rules

1. Keep normative files cross-project. Do not document project-local hacks here.
2. Put rollout details for a specific product under `PROJECTS/`.
3. If a rule is not ready for cross-project use, keep it in the project until it is.
4. Prefer durable, reviewable language over brainstorming notes.
5. Do not weaken the Mantine-only platform rule without an explicit major-version policy change.
6. Promote repeated local UI solutions into `PATTERN_SERVICE_MODEL.md` before copying them across projects.

## Validation Expectations

Before merging shared package changes, run:

- `npm run verify:release`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:run`

If a change affects root composition, shared copy, or exported component behavior, the change should include or update automated tests unless there is a documented reason it cannot.

## Adding a Component or Pattern

This is the concrete, end-to-end mechanics for shipping a new public component
or pattern. It is the practical companion to the conceptual lifecycle in
[`PATTERN_SERVICE_MODEL.md`](PATTERN_SERVICE_MODEL.md). Each new component must
pass `npm run verify:release`; the steps below are what that gate actually
checks, in the order you'll do them. Worked example: a `StatusPill` in
`@sovereignsquad/gds-core`.

1. **Create the source file(s).** Component source lives in `packages/<pkg>/src/`
   (e.g. `packages/gds-core/src/StatusPill.tsx`). If the component uses hooks,
   state, refs, or any browser API, add `'use client';` as the first line **and**
   name the file with a `.client.tsx` suffix (17 such files exist today, e.g.
   `KanbanBoard.client.tsx`); a server-safe component (no `'use client'`) is a
   plain `.tsx`. Colocate the test as `StatusPill.test.tsx` in the same folder.

2. **Export it, with JSDoc.** Add the export to the package barrel
   (`packages/gds-core/src/index.ts`) under the appropriate `// ── … ──` section
   group. Every symbol re-exported from a public entry point must carry a
   one-paragraph JSDoc (what it does + when to use it) — see the *JSDoc*
   convention below. Client-only components are additionally reachable through
   `client.ts`; server-safe ones through `server.ts`. `check-export-contract`
   fails if `server.ts` transitively reaches any `'use client'` file, so keep
   client code out of the server entry.

3. **Register it in the catalog.** Every public PascalCase UI component must be
   either registered or explicitly exempted, or `verify:component-catalog-parity`
   fails:
   - **Registered** — add (or extend) a `PatternRegistryEntry` in
     `apps/playground/src/pattern-registry.ts` with `sourceComponent: 'StatusPill'`.
     Registry membership is what drives the catalog's every-theme render,
     forced-colors check, i18n routing, and accessibility-evidence capture, so
     prefer this for anything with visible UI.
   - **Exempted** — if it is a non-catalog primitive/utility, add it to
     `boundary/component-catalog-exemptions.json` with a reason.

4. **Add export coverage.** Add an `ExportCoverageEntry` to
   `apps/playground/src/pattern-export-coverage.ts`
   (`{ packageName, exportName, status, registryId, rationale }`). **Any**
   exported `function`/`const`/`class` in package `src/` must have a coverage
   entry, or `verify:pattern-export-coverage` and `verify:api-docs-coverage`
   fail. Use `status: 'support-api'` for non-visual helpers (skips the live-demo
   evidence requirement); `registryId` must be a real `id` in `pattern-registry.ts`.

5. **Internationalize every string.** No user-facing English literal goes in a
   component. Add a `gds.*` message key and consume it via
   `useGdsTranslation().t('gds.statusPill.label', 'Status')`. The key must be
   added to **all 12 locale packs** in `packages/gds-core/src/locales/` (`en`,
   `es`, `de`, `fr`, `it`, `hu`, `ru`, `he`, `ar`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`) with full
   parity — `verify:i18n-message-parity` fails on a key missing from any pack,
   and `verify:i18n-package-copy` / `verify:locale-coverage` guard package copy
   and route coverage.

6. **Respect the vendor boundary.** Don't leak engine types (`@mantine/*`,
   `@tabler/icons-react`, `@dnd-kit/*`) into the public `.d.ts` surface, and
   don't introduce new `.mantine-*` CSS selectors — `verify:boundary` freezes
   both surfaces to an allowlist that can only shrink. Wrap vendor types behind
   GDS-owned interfaces (see `GdsDateInputBaseProps` for the pattern) and use
   GDS styling hooks.

7. **Test and verify.** Cover the component with a colocated `.test.tsx`
   (`renderWithGds` from `test-utils/render` wires the provider/router), then run
   `npm run verify:release`. The relevant sub-checks are `build`, `lint`,
   `test:run`, `verify:component-catalog-parity`, and the `verify:references`
   chain (pattern-catalog-coverage, pattern-export-coverage, api-docs-coverage,
   locale-coverage, i18n-message-parity, owned-contrast, and more).

8. **Document it.** Add the component's contract to
   `COMPONENTS_AND_PATTERNS.md` (and any deeper `docs/*.md` reference), and a
   `CHANGELOG.md` entry — per Standing Rule 3, docs ship in the same change set.

**Overlay demos (`Modal`/`Dialog`/`Drawer`/`ConfirmDialog`) must never hardcode
`opened` to a literal `true`.** A demo case rendered that way opens on first
paint and — since `onClose` in a throwaway demo is typically a no-op — can
never be dismissed, which locks page scroll and traps focus behind it,
blocking every other pattern on that page (GH-496). Give every overlay demo
real `useState` open/close behavior with a trigger button, matching
`OverlayAliasDemo` in `apps/playground/src/pattern-pages.tsx`.

## Comment & Documentation Conventions

- **Issue references.** Use bare `#NNN` (GitHub's native auto-linking format)
  in comments, CHANGELOG entries, and doc prose — not `GH-NNN` or other
  variants. **Exception:** inside any `.js`/`.jsx`/`.ts`/`.tsx` file under
  `apps/*` (the consumer-surface apps `gds-compliance`'s `strict.raw-color`
  rule scans for raw hex color literals), do **not** write a bare `#NNN`
  issue reference — every digit `0-9` is also a valid hex character, so a
  3-8 digit issue number immediately after `#` is indistinguishable from a
  CSS hex color literal (`#316` reads as valid 3-digit hex shorthand) and
  will fail `verify:release`'s compliance gate. In those files, write
  `issue NNN` (no `#`) instead. `.md` files are never scanned by this rule
  and may always use bare `#NNN`.
- **JSDoc.** Every symbol re-exported from a package's public entry point
  (`index.ts`, `client.ts`, `server.ts`) — components, hooks, and exported
  utility functions — must carry a JSDoc comment explaining what it does and
  when to use it (one paragraph is enough; see `GdsBreadcrumbs.tsx` or
  `GdsDensity.tsx` for the target style). Internal helpers, `.test.tsx`
  files, and demo/story code are exempt. This is enforced by
  `eslint-plugin-jsdoc`'s `require-jsdoc` rule, scoped to exported
  declarations only, in `@sovereignsquad/gds-eslint-config`.
- **File-header comments are not required.** This codebase has never
  consistently used them (many long-standing files, e.g. `Typography.tsx`,
  have none) and retrofitting one everywhere would be pure diff churn with
  no functional payoff. Don't add one to a file you're not otherwise
  touching; feel free to add a short one to a file you are touching for
  another reason, if it genuinely helps orient a reader.
